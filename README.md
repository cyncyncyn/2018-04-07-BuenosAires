# README

This workshop is a pilot workshop for the newly translated Software Carpentry UNIX and Git Lessons. Typically, a Software Carpentry Workshop would also teach R or Python, but we are making an exception here in  order to build a larger community of instructors in Buenos Aires. We hope that all participants in this workshop will be able to attend a remote Carpentry Instructor Training event on 11-12 Junio 2018 and then will go to teach more workshops.
